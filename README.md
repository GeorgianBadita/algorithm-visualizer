## General info

The aim of this project is to help new students starting competitive programming or data structures and algorithms courses at university level.
The application supports the following algorithms:

- **Graphs**:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Breadth First Search
  - A * Pathfinding Algorithm
  - Best First Search

## Technologies

The main technologies used for developing this project are:

- Javascript
- ReactJS
- Redux

## Setup

In order to setup the project locally, use the following commands:

```console
git clone https://github.com/GeorgianBadita/algorithm-visualizer.git
cd algorithm-visualizer
npm install
npm run start
```

## Demo

## Future work

In the future I aim to include more classes of algorithms and also polish the work that has been done so far.
I plan to include:

- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Backtracking**
