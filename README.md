## General info

The aim of this project is to help new students starting competitive programming or data structures and algorithms courses at university level.
The application supports the following algorithms:

-   **Graphs**:
    -   Dijkstra's Algorithm
    -   Breadth First Search
    -   A \* Pathfinding Algorithm
    -   Best First Search
-   **Sorting**:
    -   Bubble Sort
    -   Merge Sort
    -   Quick Sort
    -   Heap Sort

## Technologies

The main technologies used for developing this project are:

-   Javascript
-   ReactJS
-   Redux
-   ReactFullPage for the home page

## Setup

In order to setup the project locally, use the following commands:

```console
git clone https://github.com/GeorgianBadita/algorithm-visualizer.git
cd algorithm-visualizer
npm install
npm run start
```

## Future work

In the future I aim to include more classes of algorithms and also polish the work that has been done so far.
I plan to include:

-   **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**
-   **Divide and Conquer**
-   **Backtracking**
